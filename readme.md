 Essentials
 - You have 90 minutes to work on this, you don’t need to finish the whole task
 completely, but it's important that we would can see how you progress, how you
 structure your work, how you think about the task
 - Show your codes and commits in your github account (if you haven't got a github
 account, set one up)
 - Try to make tests for your code
 - If possible, provide REST API to change the data
 - **Do not focus on design, usability is the key part for the UI.
 Scope
 Consider making a catalog of your family’s (mother, father, sister, brother, you) music
 albums purchased. Each album has a title, artist, number of tracks, year of issue and can
 have multiple genres. You may want to store when and for how much each album was
 purchased for and the member of the family who made the purchase.
 Please​ ​fill​ ​up​ ​the​ ​database​ ​with​ ​at​ ​least​ ​100​ ​albums​ ​(we​ ​aren’t​ ​bothered​ ​about​ ​your
 musical​ ​preferences​ ​so​ ​the​ ​data​ ​can​ ​be​ ​make​ ​believe,​ ​but​ ​hey​ ​if​ ​you​ ​want​ ​to​ ​share
 your​ ​top​ ​100​ ​albums,​ ​go​ ​for​ ​it,​ ​it’s​ ​all​ ​good).
 Output​ ​Requirements
 Via the UI we would like to be able to generate the following statistical data:
 - Total number of albums purchased in each year and money spent on them. Should
 be orderable by year and amount.
 - Number of albums in each genres. Should be orderable descending or ascending.
 - Filter the albums by family members, showing their favourite and least favourite
 genres and their spending.
 That’s it, give it a go and let's see how you get on
